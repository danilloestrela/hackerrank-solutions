# hackerrank-solutions

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ TL/DR

Lately, I've decided to dedicate more time to studying and improving my programming logic skills. To achieve this, I've chosen to go back to basics, further solidify the knowledge I already have, and take the opportunity to refresh some concepts that may have been overlooked over time.

One of the initiatives, therefore, was to start taking up various challenges on websites like HackerRank and others that offer this opportunity either for free or paid.

Sharing this information has several advantages:

**Building a Public Portfolio:** By sharing my solutions on GitHub, I can create a public portfolio of coding projects and challenges. As I progress in my career as a developer, having a solid portfolio becomes incredibly valuable. Employers and recruiters often seek concrete evidence of programming skills, and sharing my solutions on GitHub provides a tangible way to showcase my abilities and experiences.

**Collaboration and Feedback:** I believe that collaboration is key to professional growth, and GitHub provides the perfect environment for it. Sharing my solutions on GitHub allows me to collaborate and receive feedback from talented developers. GitHub is a vibrant and active community full of experienced and passionate programmers (as I am or would like to be). By sharing my work, I have the opportunity to receive constructive feedback, optimization suggestions, and even the chance to learn from others.

**Improving Coding Skills:** Sharing my solutions challenges me to write better, cleaner code. Knowing that others can view and analyze my work encourages me to strive for elegant and efficient solutions. Additionally, GitHub offers features like code reviews, which can help identify areas for improvement and learn new techniques and approaches.

**Giving Back to the Community:** Sharing my solutions on GitHub is a way to give back to the developer community. By making my work accessible to others, I hope to help and inspire fellow programmers on their journeys. I have benefited greatly from the knowledge shared by other developers, and now it feels like my turn to contribute!

So, that's why I've decided to share my HackerRank solutions on GitHub. I hope this clarifies my reasoning and perhaps even sparks the desire in you to do the same. Let's keep learning, growing, and sharing our knowledge together!

PS.: These challenges are available free for training you on kits. But the main one I can't share here due respect to the website ðŸ˜Š

Happy coding! ðŸš€
